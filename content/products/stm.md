# Secure Traffic Manager (STM)

**Secure Traffic Manager** (STM) delivers real‑time visibility and control over network traffic and application performance. The intelligence‑driven platform provides Quality‑of‑Service (QoS) optimisation so you can monitor every bit of data, manage resources efficiently and resolve issues proactively【751767827485986†L95-L102】.

## What STM Offers

- **Real‑time traffic visibility:** STM gives you instantaneous visibility, analytics and control over your network traffic【751767827485986†L115-L123】. You can proactively manage customers based on the health of their connections and use a proprietary “distress score” to identify users with poor QoS before issues spread【751767827485986†L119-L124】. The platform also shows bandwidth consumption by application and highlights distressed applications and reasons for their poor performance【751767827485986†L126-L128】.

- **Multilevel traffic control:** STM allows advanced real‑time control at the application, user and network‑segment level【751767827485986†L132-L145】. By correlating data, you can determine whether issues are specific to a customer, application or network segment and access both real‑time and historical information【751767827485986†L136-L146】. This reduces operating overheads, increases first‑call resolution rates and decreases customer cost to serve【751767827485986†L145-L147】.

- **Advanced support tools:** STM equips customer service and technical support teams with one‑click access to live customer metrics and stores at least two years of historical data【751767827485986†L149-L160】. These tools help streamline operations, reduce cost of service and improve customer satisfaction【751767827485986†L161-L162】.

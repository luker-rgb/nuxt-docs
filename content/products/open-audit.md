# Open‑AudIT – Network Auditing & Discovery

**Open‑AudIT** tells you exactly what’s on your network, how it is configured and when it changes【867053208767986†L22-L29】. Running on Windows or Linux, it builds a database of information about your environment that you can query through an easy‑to‑use web interface【867053208767986†L22-L31】.

## What it Does

- **Comprehensive inventory:** Open‑AudIT queries Windows PCs for hardware, software, operating system settings, security settings, IIS settings, services, users and groups【867053208767986†L33-L35】. It also gathers similar information from Linux systems and network devices such as printers, switches and routers【867053208767986†L34-L37】.
- **Database and reports:** Information collected via scripts (Bash on Linux or VBScript on Windows) is stored in a human‑readable database. You can generate output in PDF, CSV or web pages, with export options for diagramming tools【867053208767986†L28-L39】.
- **Automated scanning:** Open‑AudIT can be configured to scan your network automatically. The project recommends daily scans for systems and frequent network scans so you’re notified quickly when devices or configurations change【867053208767986†L41-L45】.

## Benefits

Open‑AudIT simplifies network documentation and change tracking. By keeping an up‑to‑date inventory, administrators can spot unauthorised devices, compare configurations over time and meet compliance requirements. The open‑source code base (PHP, Bash and VBScript) makes customisation and integration straightforward【867053208767986†L28-L31】.

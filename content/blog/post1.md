# The Importance of Intelligent Network Monitoring in Hybrid Environments

As organisations adopt hybrid infrastructures spanning on‑premises and cloud environments, network complexity grows. Intelligent monitoring platforms like FirstWave’s NMIS help IT teams stay ahead by providing fault, performance and configuration management in a single system【731830903937999†L75-L97】. NMIS leverages open‑source technology to deliver proactive insights and minimise downtime【731830903937999†L105-L110】 while scaling from small networks to large enterprises【731830903937999†L161-L165】.

Modern monitoring must also adapt to changing baselines. NMIS automatically measures availability, response time and performance, comparing current metrics to historical baselines to detect anomalies【731830903937999†L152-L156】. With extensive device support—over 10,000 device types【731830903937999†L169-L174】—and a flexible rules engine【731830903937999†L114-L147】, NMIS gives teams the visibility and control needed to manage today’s hybrid networks.
